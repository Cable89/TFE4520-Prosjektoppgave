\section{Conclusion}
The existing circuit design and implementation had problems with reliability as described in \cref{reliability}. The reliability of the system was calculated by the use of a source tree based on logged faults to P(F)=0,71. After implementing a back plane design, and adding carrier wave detection on the input signal the calculated reliability increased to P(F)=0,18. This is a large increase in reliability. Portability was present in the existing implementation, and has been increased by removing failure sources that occurred when moving the system.

\section{Further work}
The next step in increasing reliability in the system is adding more complex fault detection on each module, and exploiting the status signals made available. The next step in improving the DRSSTC is looking at how different design parameters affects the performance with relation to streamer length and tone quality.
