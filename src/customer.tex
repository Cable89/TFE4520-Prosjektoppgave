\subsection{Customer}
The customers of the system is Omega Verksted, research projects, and amusement parks. These customers can be divided into two groups, customers who will be moving the DRSSTC and packing it down when not in use, and customers who will have it in a permanent installation. We will focus on the customers moving the DRSSTC around since this will put the toughest requirements on the design.
