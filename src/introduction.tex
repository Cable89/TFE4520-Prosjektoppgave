\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
The system should take audio as input and output acoustic audio by means of an high voltage electric discharge in air creating plasma by the means of a resonant transformer (tesla coil). The system should also be designed such that it will always be functional, and in the case of the system not being functional should fail in a safe and non-destructive way (safe having priority over non-destructive). As well as indicating witch part of the system is non-functional. The system should also be designed in such a way that this non-functioning part may be swapped for a spare functioning part.

\subsection{Tesla}
\label{tesla}
The Tesla Coil or resonant transformer was invented by Nikolai Tesla and used for experiments with artificial illumination \citep{5570149}. Since then the Tesla Coil has become a popular entertainment device.
