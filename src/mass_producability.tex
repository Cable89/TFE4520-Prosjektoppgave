\subsection{Mass producability}
To be able to mass produce the system some care needs to be taken during the design process.

When drawing the schematics each component has a link to a database with ordering information, price, and number and location in local warehouse.

Altium designer contains tools for automatic bill of materials (BOM) generation. This can be tailored to ones supplier, such that the output file can be uploaded to the supplier to order the components needed for manufacturing the design.

Components needs to be placed, and footprints drawn according to IPC7351(A,B, or C) to be able to manufacture the design at a factory.
