\section*{Preface}

Omega Verksted has a long tradition with providing Tesla Coil shows for the line union 'Omega' and for other student societies at NTNU. The current implementation is based on some inadequate documentation from the 2009 implementation. The 2009 implementation was in use up to 2014 and was notorious for blowing output transistors. As well as for being put together with hot glue. In 2014 an effort was begun to improve the reliability and portability of the tesla coil. A new implementation was created with the design split into modules to ease the further development. The connectors and the casing for the driver was replaced improving portability greatly. The coil rig was also replaced as it had the tendency to catch fire. This implementation still has some problems as outlined and attempted corrected in this report.

Thanks should be made to Omega Verksted who has financed the parts used for this project.
